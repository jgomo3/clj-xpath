This branch is for implementing a solution for:

  https://github.com/kyleburton/clj-xpath/issues/21

  Split clj-xpath.core into 2 parts:
  
  clj-xpath.lib
  clj-xpath.core

  lib will use no dynamic vars, it will use explicitly passed positional
  parameters for concerns such as the xpath factory and xmll namespace support.
  
  core will maintain compatibility with the exiting API, using dynamic
  variables, calling into lib passing the proper positional parameters.
